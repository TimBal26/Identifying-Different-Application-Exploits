# Identifying-Different-Application-Exploits Lab

# Project: 
The main goal of an Identifying Different Application Exploits Practice Lab is to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to identify, analyze, and defend against various types of exploits that target software applications. The lab aims to create proficient cybersecurity professionals capable of protecting organizations from the evolving threats posed by application exploits. This training is vital in preparing them to handle real-world security scenarios effectively. I did all of this using a Kali Linux 2019.4 (Standalone Server) 

# Task 1: Cross Site Scripting
This task provides simple payloads and malicious scripts to identify and exploit reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the search bar of an application. In this task, you will exploit a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability on a demo application.
- Go to https://demo.testfire.net, and login in with correct credentials. When logged in, type <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> in the search bar. Since the application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, the supplied script executes and The cookie value is now displayed in the alert box. (picture below)

# Task 2: SQL Injection 
In this task, you will learn ways to exploit error-based SQL injection. This task provides simple payloads and malicious inputs to identify and exploit error-based SQL injections in the login page of an application.
- Go to https://demo.testfire.net, and login in with credentials, but instead of Username: admin you will use admin' or 1=1-- andthen log in. Since the application is vulnerable to SQL injection, the admin’ or 1=1 condition is always true and as per SQL syntax, anything after ‘--‘ is ignored. Hence the random password value is ignored and the application allows successful login to the application. (picture below)

# Task 3: Improper Error Handling
In this task, you will learn how to uncover simple information leakage techniques that allow you to gather information.
- Stay on the san=me page as the previous task and Click on the View Recent Transactions link under the I WANT TO … section in the left pane of the web page. in the input fields type anything and click submit. Since the application does not handle inputs properly, a detailed exception is thrown that reveals underlying database information.

SQL Injection Error Message
Description: This screenshot displays an HTTP Status 500 error page caused by an SQL Injection attack on the banking application. The detailed error message includes a java.sql.SQLException, indicating a failure in the application's interaction with the database due to an improperly formatted SQL query. This suggests that the application's input validation and exception handling might be inadequate, exposing it to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

# Summary: 
Cross Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Improper Error Handling vulnerabilities can be avoided with careful coding practices, regular security testing, and staying updated with the latest security practices and patches for your development frameworks and libraries. Security awareness and education are also key, as developers who are informed about these types of attacks are more likely to prevent them.
